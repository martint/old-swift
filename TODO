* Analyzer
    It should determine which fields can be deserialized based on what's available in the target javabean. It should
    infer the class of nested structures by looking at setters / getters.

    Fail or ignore if a mapping does not exist for a field?

* Autoboxing support (setter/getters that accept Integer vs int, etc)
* Type coercion & mechanism to report truncation/coercion errors
* Annotation-based bindings?

* Ability to pass in instance of object to populate on deserialization (to avoid object creation)
* Support required vs optional fields
* Null fields
* Schema evolution
* Parser

* Better error handling

* Streaming/filtering/splicing of events (e.g., to remove deprecated fields, create new serialized objects based on existing ones by just arraycp-ing bytes instead of deserialize-serialize)
